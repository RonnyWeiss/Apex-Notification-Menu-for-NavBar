    "description": "This dynamic action plugin allows to render a notification menu which gets its information through an SQL statement. It also has many configuration options and an automatic refresh (if desired). Unfortunately, it is only available with the Universal Theme 1.1 in APEX 5.1.1 or above. If you want to use it in older Themes then you have to customize the CSS style.<p><strong>Short info about \"Commercially Supported\"</strong></p><p>My main job is at Kontron AIS Dresden GmbH, where I develope with my team, Oracle APEX and Oracle Cloud our product https://equipmentcloud.de . In my spare time I like photography and develop free software. This software is available to you free of charge and I also give support as well as my time allows! FOEX asked me if they can add some of my plug-ins to their \"APEX Plug-in Support Package\" program, for more information please visit: https://www.foex.at/plugin-support! This is an option you are welcome to take, if you need commercial support! But you don't have to!</p><p>Also this plug-in remains free and open source under MIT license!</p><p>If you have problems, you can always create an issue on GitHub or contact me via social networks (Twitter, LinkedIn...). The commercial support by FOEX is only an additional option for you. So you can choose what you want!</p>",
