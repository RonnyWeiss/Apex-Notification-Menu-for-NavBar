This dynamic action plugin allows to render a notification menu which gets its information through an SQL statement. It also has many configuration options and an automatic refresh (if desired). Unfortunately, it is only available with the Universal Theme 1.1 in APEX 5.1.1 or above. If you want to use it in older Themes then you have to customize the CSS style.

Using the Plug-in is very easy just import the it and add it as dynamic action to your apex page with e.g. "On Page Load" as Trigger. Then use as True-Action the Plug-in. The rest is set as example by default, so just start the appliaction and look into the Navigation Bar.
